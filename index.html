        <p>
            The purpose of PHS Job Finder is to help the students of Perry High School find suitable jobs that fit their busy schedules as they try to maintain personal and school responsibilities. It also helps local businesses find employees who are nearby and who match their standards.

            To submit available job postings as a business owner, you must submit a job posting request by clicking the button at the bottom. Your submission will be sent to the administrator who will review your submission to verify everything is accurate and to determine if it is a suitable job posting for the students of PHS. They will then decide whether to approve and add it to the database or to deny it.
